Hence, most employees and office workers had to shift to a remote working mode. Work-from-home (WFH), or teleworking, as a new fashion in the work arrangement type, has become a controversial topic as we walked through 2020. As graduate students, we have already collected some diverging opinions from our fellow colleagues. Some tend to easily get disturbed by different entertaining options when by themselves and have a hard time to truly focus, while others find out that studying alone helps them easily concentrate and increase their productivity while they can maintain flexible daily schedules. Students might not be the only group who face the same controversy. Therefore, it triggered our interests, as we wanted to know how work from home employees are affected by the pandemic and related policies. To solve this problem, we had to figure out how the general trends of work from home employees changed during the pandemic; whether there is a significant relationship between productivity and percentage of employees who telework; and the effect of WFH on salary within different industries and sectors over time.

Depending on the different facet of the problem we want to investigate from, the data sources vary. One of the website that we got our data from is the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which is known as one of the largest government published databases. Specifically, we utilized the data summarized from this web-page Employed persons working on main job at home and at their workplace and time spent working at each location by occupation to get the data about annual WFH population before COVID-19 (2013-2019) by sectors, and utilized the data summarized from this webpage Effects of the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic as the WFH data since May 2020, which measures the effect of COVID on the labor market from May 2020 to March 2021. Data downloaded from the previous website consist of 20 tables, containing 13 variables describing total employed population and WFH-only workers population within each occupation sector over years. Data downloaded from the latter website consists 11 tables, containing demographic, occupational, industrial and other characteristics measures about the total and WFH population. We accessed employment payrolls data collected in Employment, Hours, and Earnings from the Current Employment Statistics survey (National) by BLS from this website. The source provides information on monthly average working hours and payrolls for employees in different sectors from 2011 to 2021. All sectors belong to the Total nonfarm sector, which is divided into two main sectors: Total private and Government. Total private contains two super sectors: Goods-producing and Private service-providing. Goods-producing includes Mining and logging, Construction, and Manufactoring, which consists of Durable goods and Nondurable goods, while Private service-providing includes Trade, transportation, and utilities, Information, Financial activities, Professional and business services, Education and health services, Leisure and hospitality, and Other services. Under Trade, transportation, and utilities, there are Wholesale trade, Retail trade, Transportation and warehousing, and Utilities sectors. We also considered U.S. BLS Beta Labs as our second resource. It provided time-series employment productivity data. We wanted to show the trend of industrial-wise productivity with its correlation with the WFH portion of the labor force, so we selected the quarterly data from 2018 to 2020 by different sectors. There were six sectors in total: business, non-farm business, manufacturing, durable goods, non-durable goods and non-financial corporations. In order to compare the productivity changes, we took several features: productivity, working hours and unit labor costs. For data from each sector and each feature, we chose the same unit for comparison: output per hour for labor productivity, average weekly hours for working hours and unit labor costs. The source provided us with 18 raw data tables in total, we would merge and combine these data tables to come up with several visualized plots. 2.2 Limitations Though the data provides suitable information for our topic, it has some limitations. One issue is that for covid-concurrent data, we can only have access to the monthly summaries no earlier than May, 2020, while the before-covid data only have yearly summaries, which ended at 2019. Since we dont have the first several months data, we cannot generate a yearly summary from the covid-concurrent table. That would give us a data gap from Jan to May of 2020. We might need to give an estimate or generate a visualization of the trend when dealing with this problem. Another issue is that there is no direct data linking employment payrolls with WFH. We will need to utilize the resources in the first two links in hope to generate some insights on the change in number of WFH laborers and its possible effect on payroll amounts. For the data extracted from U.S. BLS Beta Labs, those data sets are quarterly averaged or weekly averaged. Since data for a more specific time period was not published, we could not depict a more time-sensitive change. Also, we were not able to get the first quarter data of 2021. For work from home data, we have a missing value, but this did not influence the initial analysis. Missing values were stated in 04-missing part. Another issue was that the sources provided different definitions for industrial sectors, so the sectors for productivity and payrolls could not be uniformed. To solve this issue, we matched some of the sectors to estimate our data. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation From the websites mentioned in the Data Sources section, we downloaded our data. Data from the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics followed certain formats and contained redundant headers. We removed those headers in order to import the data into R for further cleaning process. To clean the data, we carefully dealt with the missing values corresponding different types of data. Some columns were dropped respecting certain situations. We changed data type for some primary features we are interested in analyzing. For example, features representing Time were originally stored in numeric or character format; they were transformed into Date or yearmon data types to better fit the desired graphs.

That is likely due to the fact that workers from Farming Sectors are likely working from home and the standard of telework is not clearly defined for them. Also, it is noticed on the documentation of the data tables that effective with January 2011 data, occupations reflect the introduction of the 2010 Census occupational classification system. Data for 2011 and later are not strictly comparable with earlier years. For non-financial-corporation, there are only 11 rows. Productivity for the fourth quarter of 2020 is missing. However, this does not affect the analysis for productivity when plotting the time series plot. For the scatterplot, we will trimmed the WFM data to make sure two data frames are matched with no missing values.

We can see that some Sectors, such as Construction, Production, Office and Administration, Services and Transportation seem to have high volatility in the changes of WFH population percentages, with fluctuation ranging between -0.5% to 1%. Management, Business, Financial and Professional Sectors seem to have less fluctuation in the change of rate. #change of WFH workers proportion over years num_bef &lt;- before%&gt;%gather(&quot;Sector&quot;,&quot;Population&quot;,-c(Year,WFH_only))%&gt;%group_by(Year,WFH_only)%&gt;%summarise(Population = sum(Population)) totalemp_bef&lt;-num_bef%&gt;%filter(WFH_only==F)%&gt;%select(Year,totalPop = Population) wfh_bef&lt;-num_bef%&gt;%filter(WFH_only==T)%&gt;%select(wfhPop = Population) rate_bef &lt;- data.frame(totalemp_bef$Year,perc = wfh_bef$wfhPop/totalemp_bef$totalPop) num_aft &lt;- after%&gt;%gather(&quot;Sector&quot;,&quot;Population&quot;,-c(Year,WFH_only))%&gt;%group_by(Year,WFH_only)%&gt;%summarise(Population = sum(Population)) totalemp_aft&lt;-num_aft%&gt;%filter(WFH_only==F)%&gt;%select(Time = Year,totalPop = Population) wfh_aft&lt;-num_aft%&gt;%filter(WFH_only==T)%&gt;%select(wfhPop = Population) wfh_aft$Original &lt;- totalemp_aft$totalPop-wfh_aft$wfhPop wfh_aft&lt;-wfh_aft%&gt;%gather(&quot;Status&quot;,&quot;Population&quot;,-Year) #stack bar plot for increase of wfh population due to covid ggplot(data = wfh_aft,aes(x = Year,y = Population,fill = Status))+ geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;)+ ggtitle(&quot;Time Series Analysis on \\nthe Increase of Telework population due to COVID&quot;) In general, we can see that the increase of telework population due to covid has a greater portion among the number of all employed workers starting from May 2020 and its proportion started to decrease as time pass by. Even though we could not get the data before May 2020, this trend may suggest that at the beginning of 2020, when COVID had just begun, the ratio of covid-lead WFH population over the total employed population would be even higher. Another trend we can see from the graph is that the total employed workers number is gradually increasing.
