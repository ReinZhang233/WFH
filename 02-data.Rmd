# Data sources


The data used for this project is downloaded from several different websites that contain census data related to telecommunicating population. Depending on the different facet of the problem we want to investigate from, the data sources varies. One of the website that we got our data from is [the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/), which is known as one of the largest government published databases. Specifically, we utilized the data summarized from this web-page [Employed persons working on main job at home and at their workplace and time spent working at each location by occupation](https://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/tustab7.htm) to get the data about annual WFH population before COVID-19 (2013-2019) by sectors, and utilized the data summarized from this webpage [Effects of the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.bls.gov/cps/effects-of-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic.htm#data) as the WFH data since May 2020, which measures the effect of COVID on the labor market from May 2020 to March 2021. Data downloaded from the previous website consist of 20 tables, containing 13 variables describing total employed population and WFH-only workers' population within each occupation sector over years. Data downloaded from the latter website consists 11 tables, containing demographic, occupational, industrial and other characteristics measures about the total and WFH population.

We also considered [U.S. BLS Beta Labs](https://beta.bls.gov/dataQuery/find?st=220&r=20&s=score%3AD&fq=survey:[pr]&more=0) as our second resource. It provided time-series employment productivity data. We wanted to show the trend of industrial-wise productivity with its correlation with the WFH portion of the labor force, so we selected the quarterly data from 2018 to 2020 by different sectors. There were six sectors in total: business, non-farm business, manufacturing, durable goods, non-durable goods and non-financial corporations. In order to compare the productivity changes, we took several features: productivity, working hours and unit labor costs. For data from each sector and each feature, we chose the same unit for comparison: output per hour for labor productivity, average weekly hours for working hours and unit labor costs. The source provided us with 18 raw data tables in total, we would merge and combine these data tables to come up with several visualized plots.
