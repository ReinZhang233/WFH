# Data transformation

From the websites mentioned in the Data Sources section, we downloaded our data. Data from [the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/) followed certain formats and contained redundant headers. We removed those headers in order to import the data into R for further cleaning process. 


To clean the data, we carefully dealt with the missing values corresponding different types of data. Some columns were dropped respecting certain situations.

We changed data type for some primary features we are interested in analyzing. For example, features representing Time as originally stored in numeric or character format; they were transformed into "Date" or "yearmon" data types to better fit the desired graphs.
